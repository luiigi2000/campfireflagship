Please read my warning messages at the bottom before starting.

The goal of my conveyer game is to drag the food backwards on the conveyer to prevent them from flying off.

The bombs destroy food and the ice freezes them.

Different foods give you a different amount of calories/points.

The trash can in the bottom left allows you to discard a food for no loss which its storage can be upgraded.

After finishing every round, there a shop phase where you can buy a random powerup that can help you after you move forward.

Every round indicated by a star at the top right of the screen is a bonus round to toughen up your game and make you a sushi master (Staggered conveyers or tied foods).

Last as long as you can, the conveyers will get faster every round. If you drop 25 food, your out.



PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU RESIZE YOUR SCREEN TO THE CORRECT RATIO (NO GREY BOX AROUND THE GAME WINDOW.

ALSO DONT DRAG YOUR MOUSE OFF THE SCREEN ( ANOTHER ITCH ISSUE )
